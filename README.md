- 👋 Hi, I’m @sudeeprp
- 👀 I’m interested in the journey of predictability in software development.
- 🌱 I’m learning to specify with LLMs and automate deployments
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Ramanuja's commentary on the Gita. [Here's the translation](https://github.com/RaPaLearning/gita-begin). There are many interpretations in there. It would be great to have discussions and critiques on them.
